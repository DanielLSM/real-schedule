# The idea to implement here is simple. We are gonna implement
# branch and bound with RL, for now lets implement branch and bound
# we need a way to formulate MILPS on the fly, compare with general MILP
# fit checks on/tasks on due dates, thats it. variables are
# maintenance opportunity by time.
# resctriction is due date, objective function is?
# minimize tardiness, with equal costs? yes
# okay
